# EasyCalculatorForGitHub
This is a really simple calculator in Java, this project I didn't start to test or show my skills in Java because it's a really simple project and the code is really, really bad. I coded this project to get to know GitHub better and I think I succeeded and I hope to work with other people on more, cooler and better projects here in the future. 
(seriously, you don't want to look at the code, if you still want to, use safty protection, you might regret it if you don't)
